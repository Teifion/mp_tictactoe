Originally I was going to use twisted for networking but I couldn't work it
out and any questions I asked seemed to be misunderstood to the extent I
figured twisted was not the way to go on this one.

I found http://pygame.org/project-NetPong-1377-.html and produced
mp tic_tac_toe.

Running the program normally:

    python main.py

Running the program to connect to another server:

    python main.py <address> <port>
    
    e.g. python main.py 192.168.0.52 31500

Running two copies of the program at the same time can be achieved with:

    python main.py dual

This will use multiprocessing to start two clients rather than just one.
